  Docker Development Guidelines:
  - Always use specific base image versions (e.g., `node:18-alpine` not `node:latest`)
  - Minimize the number of layers by combining related commands
  - Use multi-stage builds for production images
  - Never run containers as root user
  - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
  - Implement proper health checks in containers
  - Use named volumes for persistent data
  - Set appropriate resource limits (memory, CPU)
  - Use environment variables for configuration, not hardcoded values
  - Implement proper logging that outputs to stdout/stderr
  - Use read-only filesystems where possible
  - Scan images for security vulnerabilities
  - Optimize for smaller image sizes in production
  - Use private networks for inter-service communication
  - Implement proper secrets management
  - Design containers to be stateless when possible
