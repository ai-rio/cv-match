## Strategic Decisions Guidelines

### When to Offer Discounts
- **YES**: First-time buyers (24h urgency), annual plans (20% off), referrals
- **NO**: Regular users (trains them to wait), churned users too often (dilutes brand)

### When to Add Features
- **YES**: If requested by 3+ enterprise clients or 20+ users
- **NO**: If <5% of users would benefit (focus on core value)

### When to Raise Prices
- **Indicators**: LTV:CAC > 5:1, churn < 10%, NPS > 50, waitlist for enterprise
- **Strategy**: Grandfather existing users, new users pay new price

### When to Expand Markets
- **Ready**: When Brazil MRR > R$ 100K, churn < 12%, proven unit economics
- **Next Markets**: Portugal (same language), then Spanish LATAM (Mexico, Colombia)
