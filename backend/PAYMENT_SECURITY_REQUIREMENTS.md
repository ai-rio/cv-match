# Payment Security Requirements

## üîê Critical Security Requirements

This document outlines the security requirements for payment processing in CV-Match.

### HTTPS Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### Production Environment
- **HTTPS is REQUIRED for all payment endpoints in production**
- Stripe webhooks will ONLY work with HTTPS URLs in production
- All checkout sessions must use HTTPS success/cancel URLs
- No HTTP endpoints allowed for payment processing

#### Development Environment
- HTTP is acceptable for local development (localhost)
- Stripe test mode works with HTTP for local development
- Webhook testing requires tools like `ngrok` or Stripe CLI for HTTPS tunneling

### SSL/TLS Configuration
```bash
# Production SSL certificate requirements
- Minimum TLS 1.2
- Valid SSL certificate from trusted CA
- HSTS headers enabled
- Secure flag on cookies
```

## üö´ Sensitive Data Handling

### Never Log These Items:
- Full credit card numbers
- CVV codes
- Expiration dates
- Stripe raw objects
- Customer payment method details
- Full API keys (use masked versions)

### Safe to Log:
- User IDs
- Session IDs (partial, e.g., `cs_***...xyz`)
- Payment amounts
- Currency codes
- Payment statuses
- Plan types
- Timestamps

## üîÑ Idempotency Requirements

### Payment Processing
- All payment operations must be idempotent
- Check for existing payments before processing
- Use unique identifiers to prevent duplicate processing
- Implement retry logic with idempotency keys

### Webhook Processing
- Verify webhook signature before processing
- Use event IDs for deduplication
- Store processed event IDs to prevent replay attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required environment variables (NEVER commit actual values)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Use .env.example for documentation only
```

### API Key Security
- Use test keys in development (`sk_test_`)
- Use live keys only in production (`sk_live_`)
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor key usage

### Webhook Security
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Use timestamp tolerance (300 seconds)
- Reject malformed payloads
- Log signature verification failures

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Required Logging
- Payment successes/failures
- Webhook verification attempts
- Signature verification failures
- Duplicate payment attempts
- API error responses

### Alert Monitoring
- Multiple failed payments for same user
- Unusual payment patterns
- Webhook signature failures
- API rate limit exceeded

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Verify HTTPS certificate is valid
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint with HTTPS
- [ ] Confirm all environment variables are set
- [ ] Run security audit on payment code
- [ ] Test with Stripe test mode first

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor first live transactions
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery
- [ ] Check SSL certificate security
- [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Review security logs

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident
1. Immediately rotate Stripe API keys
2. Review recent transactions for anomalies
3. Enable additional monitoring
4. Document the incident
5. Notify stakeholders

### Service Outage
1. Check Stripe status dashboard
2. Verify webhook connectivity
3. Review recent deployments
4. Check SSL certificate validity
5. Communicate with users
