# Phase 0.1 Security Implementation Summary
## Critical User Authorization Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Data Breach Vulnerability
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Vulnerabilities Fixed

---

## üö® Security Issue Identified

### Critical Vulnerability: Complete Lack of User Authorization

**Problem**: Any authenticated user could access ANY resume in the system, creating a severe data breach vulnerability that violates LGPD (Brazilian Data Protection Law).

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå User 1 could view User 2's resume data
- ‚ùå User 1 could delete User 2's resume data
- ‚ùå User 1 could list ALL resumes in the system
- ‚ùå No user ownership validation anywhere in the system
- ‚ùå Database schema lacked user association

**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Illegal to deploy in Brazil under LGPD

---

## ‚úÖ Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Security

**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20251013000001_add_user_authorization_to_resumes.sql`

```sql
-- Added user_id column with proper constraints
ALTER TABLE public.resumes ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE public.resumes ADD CONSTRAINT resumes_user_id_not_null CHECK (user_id IS NOT NULL);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_resumes_user_id ON public.resumes(user_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Database-Level Protection**:

```sql
-- Users can only view their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own resumes"
    ON public.resumes
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Users can only insert their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own resumes"
    ON public.resumes
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only update their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own resumes"
    ON public.resumes
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only delete their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own resumes"
    ON public.resumes
    FOR DELETE
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 3. Application Layer Authorization

**File**: `/backend/app/api/endpoints/resumes.py`

#### Upload Endpoint - Fixed
```python
# BEFORE: No user association
resume_id = await resume_service.convert_and_store_resume(...)

# AFTER: User ownership enforced
resume_id = await resume_service.convert_and_store_resume(
    file_bytes=file_content,
    file_type=file.content_type,
    filename=safe_filename,
    content_type="md",
    user_id=current_user["id"]  # CRITICAL: Associate with user
)
```

#### Get Endpoint - Fixed
```python
# BEFORE: No ownership check
resume_data = await resume_service.get_resume_with_processed_data(resume_id)
return ResumeResponse(...)

# AFTER: User ownership validation
resume_data = await resume_service.get_resume_with_processed_data(resume_id)
if not resume_data:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Resume not found")

# CRITICAL SECURITY: Verify user ownership
resume_user_id = resume_data.get("raw_resume", {}).get("user_id")
if not resume_user_id or resume_user_id != current_user["id"]:
    logger.warning(f"User {current_user['id']} attempted to access resume {resume_id} owned by {resume_user_id}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: Resume not found")
```

#### List Endpoint - Fixed
```python
# BEFORE: Returns ALL resumes
resumes_data = await service.list(limit=limit, offset=offset)

# AFTER: Only user's own resumes
filters = {"user_id": current_user["id"]}
query = service.supabase.table("resumes").select("*").eq("user_id", current_user["id"])

# Defense in depth: Double-check ownership
for resume_dict in resumes_data:
    if resume_dict.get("user_id") != current_user["id"]:
        logger.error(f"SECURITY VIOLATION: User {current_user['id']} received resume owned by {resume_dict.get('user_id')}")
        continue  # Skip unauthorized data
```

#### Delete Endpoint - Fixed
```python
# BEFORE: No ownership check
await service.delete(resume_id)

# AFTER: User ownership validation
resume_data = await resume_service.get_resume_with_processed_data(resume_id)
resume_user_id = resume_data.get("raw_resume", {}).get("user_id")
if not resume_user_id or resume_user_id != current_user["id"]:
    logger.warning(f"User {current_user['id']} attempted to delete resume {resume_id} owned by {resume_user_id}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: Resume not found")
```

### 4. Service Layer Security

**File**: `/backend/app/services/resume_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE: No user association
async def convert_and_store_resume(self, file_bytes, file_type, filename, content_type="md"):

# AFTER: User ownership required
async def convert_and_store_resume(self, file_bytes, file_type, filename, content_type="md", user_id: str = None):
    if user_id is None:
        raise ValueError("user_id is required for resume storage")

# Database storage includes user ownership
resume_data = {
    "resume_id": resume_id,
    "content": text_content,
    "content_type": db_content_type,
    "user_id": user_id,  # CRITICAL: User ownership for security
}
```

### 5. Model Updates

**File**: `/backend/app/models/resume.py`

```python
class ResumeUploadResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(..., description="Resume ID")
    filename: str = Field(..., description="Original filename")
    extracted_text: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Extracted text content from resume")
    content_type: str = Field(..., description="Content type of the extracted text")
    user_id: str = Field(..., description="User ID who owns this resume")  # NEW
    created_at: datetime = Field(..., description="Upload timestamp")

class ResumeResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(..., description="Resume ID")
    filename: str = Field(..., description="Original filename")
    extracted_text: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Extracted text content from resume")
    content_type: str = Field(..., description="Content type of the extracted text")
    user_id: str = Field(..., description="User ID who owns this resume")  # NEW
    created_at: datetime = Field(..., description="Creation timestamp")
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, description="Last update timestamp")
```

### 6. Comprehensive Authorization Tests

**File**: `/backend/tests/unit/test_resume_authorization.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- ‚úÖ Users can access their own resumes
- ‚úÖ Users cannot access other users' resumes
- ‚úÖ Users can only list their own resumes
- ‚úÖ Users can only delete their own resumes
- ‚úÖ Service layer enforces user ownership
- ‚úÖ Security violations are logged
- ‚úÖ Defense in depth verification
- ‚úÖ Error handling doesn't leak information

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Implementation

**Layer 1: Database-Level (Primary)**
- RLS policies enforce `auth.uid() = user_id`
- Automatic user data isolation
- Cannot be bypassed by application code

**Layer 2: Application-Level (Secondary)**
- Explicit user ownership validation in all endpoints
- Server-side authorization checks
- Comprehensive error handling

**Layer 3: Service-Level (Tertiary)**
- ResumeService requires user_id for all operations
- Data integrity validation
- Business logic enforcement

### Security Logging

**Events Logged**:
- Failed access attempts: `User {user_id} attempted to access resume {resume_id} owned by {owner_id}`
- Security violations: `SECURITY VIOLATION: User {user_id} received resume owned by {owner_id}`
- Successful operations: `Resume {resume_id} stored/deleted/accessed by user {user_id}`

## üìã Deployment Requirements

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Apply critical security migration
supabase db push

# Verify migration applied
supabase migration list
```

### 2. Data Migration (PLANNING REQUIRED)
**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Decision Needed**: Existing resumes without user_id

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Assign to system user for archival
- **Option B**: Implement user claim process
- **Option C**: Delete orphaned records (LGPD compliant)

### 3. Code Deployment
- Backend endpoints updated with authorization
- Models include user_id fields
- Service layer validates user ownership
- Tests cover authorization scenarios
