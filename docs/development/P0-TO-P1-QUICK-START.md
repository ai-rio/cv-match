**Status**: After P0 (Frontend Migration) → Before P1 (Payment Integration)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

You've just completed **P0 (Frontend Migration)** and need to verify all services are working before moving to **P1 (Payment Integration)**. This guide shows you the fastest way to certify your system is ready.

---

## ⚡ Quick Verification (5-10 minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Run the automated verification script that checks everything for you:

```bash
# From project root
chmod +x scripts/verify-p0.sh
./scripts/verify-p0.sh
```

**What it checks**:

- ✅ Docker services running
- ✅ Database connectivity
- ✅ Backend services operational
- ✅ All 65 backend tests passing
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ i18n configured (next-intl, PT-BR translations)
- ✅ Environment variables set
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met

**Expected output**:

```
✅ Passed:   25
❌ Failed:   0
⚠️  Warnings: 2
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Total:    27

Success Rate: 92%

🎉 All checks passed! Ready to proceed to P1.
```

### Option 2: Manual Quick Check (if script fails)

```bash
# 1. Check Docker services
docker compose ps
# Expected: All services "Up"

# 2. Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", ...}

# 3. Run backend tests
cd backend
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
# Expected: 65/65 passed

# 4. Test frontend build
cd ../frontend
bun run build
# Expected: Build completes without errors

# 5. Check translations
ls locales/pt-br/*.json | wc -l
# Expected: 11 files
```

## 📋 Full Verification (30-60 minutes)

For complete peace of mind before P1, follow the comprehensive checklist:

**Location**: `docs/development/P0-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`

This includes:

- Infrastructure health checks
- Backend services verification
- Frontend functionality tests
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Security verification
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation review

---

## 🚦 Decision Point: Are You Ready for P1?

### ✅ YES - Proceed to P1 if:

- Automated script shows all critical checks passing
- You can complete the user journey: Upload resume → Analyze → View results
- PT-BR translations display correctly
- No critical errors in logs
- Performance is acceptable (<30s for analysis)

### ❌ NO - Fix issues first if:

- Backend tests failing
- Frontend won't build
- Database connection failing
- Critical services not importing
- User journey broken

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Backend tests failing"

**Symptoms**: pytest shows failing tests
**Fix**:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest tests/unit/ -vv --tb=long
# Review error messages
# Fix failing tests
# Re-run verification
```

### Issue: "Frontend build failing"

**Symptoms**: TypeScript errors, missing dependencies
**Fix**:

```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf .next node_modules
bun install
bun run build
```

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Symptoms**: Can't connect to Supabase
**Fix**:

```bash
# Check environment variables
cat backend/.env | grep SUPABASE

# Test connection manually
cd backend
docker compose exec backend python -c "
from app.core.database import get_supabase_client
client = get_supabase_client()
print('✅ Connected')
"
```

### Issue: "Docker services not running"

**Symptoms**: `docker compose ps` shows no services
**Fix**:

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs backend --tail=50
docker compose logs frontend --tail=50
```

## 📊 What P1 Will Add

Once P0 is verified, P1 (Payment Integration) will add:

- Stripe payment processing (BRL support)
- Payment webhook handling
- Usage tracking and credit system
- Pricing pages
- Subscription management
- Invoice generation

**Estimated time**: 1 week (from ROADMAP)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run verification**: `./scripts/verify-p0.sh`

2. **If all pass**:
   - ✅ Mark P0 as complete in ROADMAP
   - ✅ Update status in README
   - ✅ Start P1 Payment Integration
   - ✅ Follow: `docs/development/ROADMAP.md` Week 3 tasks

3. **If any fail**:
   - ⚠️ Review failed checks
   - ⚠️ Fix issues one by one
   - ⚠️ Re-run verification
   - ⚠️ Use detailed checklist for debugging

---

## 📚 Reference Documents

- **Automated Script**: `scripts/verify-p0.sh`
- **Detailed Checklist**: `docs/development/P0-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- **Project Roadmap**: `docs/development/ROADMAP.md`
- **Development Guide**: `docs/development/README.md`
- **Backend Tests**: `backend/tests/README.md`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run verification frequently**: After any significant changes
2. **Keep logs**: Save verification output for debugging
3. **Use detailed checklist**: When automated script fails
4. **Test in isolation**: If one check fails, test that service individually
5. **Update documentation**: Keep P0-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md current

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. Check logs:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend --tail=100
   docker compose logs frontend --tail=100
   ```

2. Review detailed checklist:

   ```bash
   cat docs/development/P0-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md
   ```

3. Check backend test output:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker compose exec backend python -m pytest tests/unit/ -vv
   ```

4. Review project documentation:
   - Architecture: `docs/development/architecture-overview.md`
   - Implementation: `docs/development/implementation-guide.md`
   - Business Model: `docs/development/business-model-analysis.md`

## ✨ Success Criteria

**You're ready for P1 when**:

- ✅ Automated verification passes (or only minor warnings)
- ✅ You can successfully complete: Upload → Analyze → View Results
- ✅ PT-BR interface works correctly
- ✅ All 65 backend tests pass
- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ No critical bugs or service failures

---

**Remember**: It's better to fix issues now than to discover them during P1 payment integration. Take the time to ensure P0 is solid! 🚀

**Status Check**: Run `./scripts/verify-p0.sh` now to get started! 🎯
