# PII Detection & LGPD Compliance

**Agent**: backend-specialist
**Time**: 6 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

## Problem

No PII detection, no LGPD compliance, no data retention policies, and potential data exposure in logs. This makes the system **ILLEGAL to deploy in Brazil** under Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) requirements.

## Security Requirements

- Implement PII detection for Brazilian context (CPF, CNPJ, phone, CEP, email, etc.)
- Create data masking and protection mechanisms for logs and responses
- Build LGPD compliance workflows with user consent tracking
- Implement data retention policies and automated deletion
- Add right to be forgotten functionality (data deletion requests)
- Create audit logging for all data processing activities
- Implement consent management and verification middleware

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PII detection service identifies Brazilian PII with 95%+ accuracy
- [ ] All detected PII is properly masked in logs and API responses
- [ ] LGPD database schema created with proper RLS policies
- [ ] User consent tracking system records all consent changes
- [ ] Data requests (access, correction, deletion, portability) functional
- [ ] Data protection middleware prevents PII exposure in logs
- [ ] Automated data retention policies enforce deletion timelines
- [ ] Privacy policy management and consent workflows operational

## Technical Constraints

- Must comply with Brazilian LGPD legal requirements
- Cannot store or log unmasked PII under any circumstances
- Must maintain audit trail for all consent changes and data requests
- Performance impact must be minimal (<30ms additional latency)
- All LGPD features must be reversible for testing
- Must integrate with existing authentication system
- Database migrations must handle existing user data appropriately

## Testing Requirements

- PII detection tests with Brazilian personal data samples
- Data masking verification confirms no PII exposure in logs
- LGPD compliance workflow tests (consent, requests, deletion)
- Performance tests ensure minimal impact on system response times
- Data retention policy tests verify automated deletion
- Audit trail tests confirm complete compliance logging
- Right to be forgotten tests verify complete data removal

## Context

This addresses critical legal compliance vulnerability. LGPD violation can result in severe fines (up to 4% of global revenue), business closure, and legal action. Brazilian market entry is impossible without proper LGPD compliance implementation.

Phase can be executed in parallel with Phase 0.4 (Mock Data Removal).
