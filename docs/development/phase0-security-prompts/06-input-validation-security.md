# Input Validation Security

**Agent**: backend-specialist
**Time**: 4 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

## Problem

Missing input validation on all API endpoints creates security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, and unauthorized data access. System lacks rate limiting, security headers, and CORS configuration, making it vulnerable to common web application attacks.

## Security Requirements

- Implement input validation for all API endpoints
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- Configure security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Add request/response sanitization for XSS prevention
- Implement SQL injection prevention in database queries
- Create API input validation middleware
- Add request size limits and type checking
- Log security events and violations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All API endpoints validate input data types and formats
- [ ] Rate limiting active on all sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Security headers properly configured (CORS, CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention implemented in all database queries
- [ XSS protection active in all responses
- Request size limits enforced for all endpoints
- Security events logged for audit trail
- Input validation middleware covers all critical endpoints

## Technical Constraints

- Cannot break existing API functionality
- Must maintain API response times (<100ms additional latency)
- All validation rules must be configurable
- Cannot interfere with legitimate user inputs
- Must work with existing authentication system
- Database queries must use parameterized queries
- Error responses must not reveal system information

## Testing Requirements

- Input validation tests with malicious payloads
- SQL injection attempts blocked and logged
- XSS attempts blocked and sanitized
- Rate limiting tests with various request patterns
- Security headers verification tests
- CORS policy validation tests
- Performance impact assessment
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions

## Context

This addresses critical security vulnerability in web application layer. Missing input validation exposes system to common web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS attacks. Comprehensive input validation is essential for secure web application deployment.

Phase can be executed in parallel with Phase 0.6 (Bias Detection Implementation).
