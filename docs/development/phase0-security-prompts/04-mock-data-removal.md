# Mock Data Removal

**Agent**: backend-specialist
**Time**: 4 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

## Problem

System contains hardcoded fake data in production code paths, making core CV matching functionality non-functional. This returns fake analysis results instead of real processing, making the entire product unusable and misleading to users.

## Security Requirements

- Remove all hardcoded fake data from production code paths
- Replace mock implementations with proper error handling
- Implement feature tracking for incomplete AI integrations
- Add fallback mechanisms for missing services
- Create production readiness validation system
- Ensure users never receive fake or misleading data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All hardcoded fake data removed from services and APIs
- [ ] Mock implementations replaced with NotImplementedError or proper errors
- [ ] Feature tracking system monitors incomplete functionality
- [ ] Missing AI integration clearly communicated to users
- [ ] Production readiness validation passes all checks
- [ ] No critical functionality returns fake data
- [ ] TODO comments properly tracked and managed
- [ ] System provides clear feedback for unavailable features

## Technical Constraints

- Cannot break existing functionality when removing mock data
- Must provide graceful degradation for missing AI features
- Error messages must be user-friendly and informative
- Feature flags must allow controlled rollout of incomplete features
- All changes must be reversible for testing
- Cannot compromise system stability during transition

## Testing Requirements

- Mock data detection scan confirms no hardcoded fake data remains
- Error handling tests verify proper responses for missing features
- Feature tracking tests confirm accurate status reporting
- Production readiness validation passes all checks
- User experience tests confirm no fake data exposure
- Graceful degradation tests verify system stability

## Context

This addresses critical production readiness issue. Users receiving fake analysis results undermines trust and makes the product non-functional. Proper error handling and feature tracking are essential for transparent user experience during AI integration development.

Phase can be executed in parallel with Phase 0.3 (PII & LGPD Compliance).
