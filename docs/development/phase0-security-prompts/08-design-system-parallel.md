**Agent**: frontend-specialist
**Time**: 28 hours
**Priority**: HIGH - Can start when Phase 0.2 is 80% complete
**Dependencies**: Phase 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 must be 80% complete

## Problem

Missing comprehensive design system for production deployment, including OKLCH colors, typography system, component library, dark/light themes, and accessibility features. Current design lacks professional polish and accessibility compliance with WCAG standards.

- Add accessibility testing and verification
- Create design system documentation and guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OKLCH color system implemented with proper contrast ratios
- [ ] Typography system ready for Brazilian Portuguese content
- Reusable component library with consistent styling
- Dark/light theme switching functionality operational
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- Accessibility testing passes for all components
- Design system documentation complete
- No hardcoded styles remain in components

## Technical Constraints

- Must work with existing Next.js 15+ app router
- Cannot break existing page functionality
- Must maintain performance standards
- Must integrate with existing authentication
- All components must be accessible
- Must support Brazilian Portuguese content
- Cannot compromise page performance

## Testing Requirements

- Accessibility verification with WCAG testing tools
- Color contrast verification for all themes
- Typography rendering with Portuguese content
- Component library functionality tests
- Theme switching functionality tests
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Accessibility audit results

## Context

This addresses missing professional UI/UX infrastructure for production deployment. Comprehensive design system is essential for professional appearance and user experience. Can start when Phase 0.2 is 80% complete to optimize parallel development.

This is a critical UX requirement for production readiness that can run parallel with backend security work.
