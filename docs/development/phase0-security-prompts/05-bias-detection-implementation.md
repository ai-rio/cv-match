# Bias Detection Implementation

**Agent**: ai-integration-specialist
**Time**: 4 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

## Problem

Current AI scoring system has no bias detection or anti-discrimination rules, making it potentially discriminatory and legally non-compliant with Brazilian equality laws. System could produce discriminatory results, leading to legal liability, reputational damage, and ethical violations.

## Security Requirements

- Implement AI bias detection algorithms for Brazilian context (age, gender, race, disability, etc.)
- Add anti-discrimination rules to all AI prompts
- Create fairness metrics calculation and monitoring
- Implement bias detection in resume-job matching algorithms
- Build ethical AI framework compliance
- Create audit trails for all AI decision-making
- Ensure transparency in AI scoring and recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bias detection framework identifies all types of bias with 95%+ accuracy
- [ ] All AI prompts include comprehensive anti-discrimination rules
- [ ] Fairness metrics calculated for all protected characteristics
- [ ] Real-time bias monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] AI responses validated for bias compliance before returning
- [ Brazilian legal compliance framework fully integrated
- AI scoring decisions transparent and auditable

## Technical Constraints

- Must comply with Brazilian anti-discrimination laws
- Cannot compromise AI functionality while preventing bias
- Must maintain transparency in AI decision-making
- Provide clear explanations for all scoring decisions
- Cannot add significant latency to AI processing
- Must integrate with existing AI scoring system
- All changes must be reversible for testing

## Testing Requirements

- Bias detection tests with Brazilian demographic data samples
- Anti-discrimination prompt tests verify proper rule enforcement
- Fairness metrics calculation accuracy validation
- Real-time bias monitoring test with sample decisions
- AI response validation for bias compliance
- Legal compliance verification with Brazilian standards
- Performance tests ensure minimal impact on system response times
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions

## Context

This addresses critical ethical and legal vulnerability. Without bias detection, the system could produce discriminatory results, violating Brazilian equality laws (Constituição Federal, Lei 7.716/1989, Estatuto da Igualdade Racial). Ethical AI framework compliance is essential for legal deployment and user trust.

Phase can be executed in parallel with Phase 0.6 (Input Validation Security).
