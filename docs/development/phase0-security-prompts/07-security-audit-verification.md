# Security Audit Verification

**Agent**: code-reviewer-agent
**Time**: 6 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Dependencies**: Phase 1-3 complete and verified

## Problem

Need comprehensive security audit verification to ensure all Phase 0 security fixes are properly implemented and working. Cannot proceed to production without confirming all security vulnerabilities have been resolved.

## Security Requirements

- Comprehensive penetration testing of all security fixes
- Vulnerability scanning with automated tools
- Security audit of authorization and data isolation
- Performance impact assessment of security changes
- Compliance verification with LGPD requirements
- Security audit logging and monitoring verification
- Penetration testing of all critical endpoints
- Manual security verification procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Penetration testing finds no critical security vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability scan shows zero critical issues
- Security audit confirms all fixes are working correctly
- Authorization testing confirms data isolation
- Performance impact is acceptable (<20% additional latency)
- LGPD compliance verification passed
- Security monitoring systems operational
- All critical endpoints have security coverage
- Security audit report generated and reviewed

## Technical Constraints

- Must complete after all Phase 1-3 security fixes are complete
- Cannot proceed to production without passing security audit
- Must use industry-standard security testing tools
- Must verify all security features are operational
- Cannot modify core security requirements
- Must produce comprehensive audit documentation
- Must include rollback procedures if issues found

## Testing Requirements

- Automated penetration testing of all endpoints
- Vulnerability scanning with security assessment tools
- Manual security verification procedures
- Authorization testing with different user scenarios
- Data isolation verification tests
- Performance impact assessment
- LGPD compliance verification
- Edge case security testing
- Security audit report generation

## Context

This addresses comprehensive security audit requirement. Cannot proceed to production without verifying all security fixes are properly implemented and working. Critical for ensuring system security before production deployment.

Phase must complete after all Phase 1-3 security fixes are complete and verified.

## Security Audit Requirements

### Critical Areas to Audit

- User authorization and data isolation
- Database schema security and RLS policies
- PII detection and LGPD compliance
- Mock data removal and production readiness
- Bias detection implementation
- Input validation security

### Audit Tools Required

- OWASP ZAP or similar penetration testing tool
- SQLMap or similar database security scanner
- Nmap or similar network scanner
- Custom security audit scripts
- Compliance verification tools

### Success Metrics

- Zero critical vulnerabilities found
- Zero high-severity issues
- Performance impact acceptable (<20% overhead)
- All security features operational
- Compliance verification passed
- Audit report complete

This is the final checkpoint before production deployment.
