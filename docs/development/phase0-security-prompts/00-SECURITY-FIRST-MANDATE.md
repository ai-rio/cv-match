## üéØ Executive Summary

### The Situation: Critical Security Vulnerabilities

CV-Match currently has **8 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** that make the system **ILLEGAL to deploy in Brazil**. These are not minor issues - they represent fundamental failures in security architecture that violate Brazilian law and expose the company to severe legal and financial consequences.

### The Mandate: Security-First Development

Phase 0 security implementation is **NOT OPTIONAL** - it is a **legal and business requirement** that must be completed before any other development work. This mandate establishes:

1. **Legal Obligation**: LGPD compliance is mandatory for Brazilian market operation
2. **Business Necessity**: Without security, the business cannot generate revenue
3. **Ethical Responsibility**: User data protection is a fundamental obligation
4. **Investment Requirement**: Security is prerequisite for funding

### The Timeline: Immediate Action Required

Security fixes must be completed **immediately** - every day of delay increases legal risk and prevents revenue generation. The 1-2 week timeline is aggressive because the business cannot operate legally until these issues are resolved.
