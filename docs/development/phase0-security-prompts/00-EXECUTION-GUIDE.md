## üéØ Execution Overview

### Strategy: Security-First Parallel Execution

The Phase 0 implementation uses a **massively parallel execution model** based on the actual prompt dependencies:

- **Massive Parallel**: 6 security fixes can start immediately with no dependencies
- **Sequential Audit**: Security audit runs after all fixes are complete
- **Frontend Parallel**: Design system starts when core security is 80% complete
- **Critical Path**: All security fixes are blockers for production deployment

### Agent Assignment Matrix

| Phase | Agent                     | Role                        | Time | Dependencies            |
| ----- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| 0.1   | backend-specialist        | User Authorization Fixes    | 6h   | None ‚úÖ                 |
| 0.2   | database-architect        | Database Schema Security    | 4h   | None ‚úÖ                 |
