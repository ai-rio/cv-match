## 🛡️ ANTI-DISCRIMINATION FRAMEWORK

### Core Anti-Discrimination Rules

All LLM prompts now include comprehensive anti-discrimination rules:

```
CRITICAL - REGRAS ANTI-DISCRIMINAÇÃO (Lei Brasileira):
- NÃO CONSIDERAR: idade, gênero, raça/etnia, religião, orientação sexual, deficiência
- NÃO PENALIZAR: intervalos de emprego, trajetórias não tradicionais, background social
- NÃO DISCRIMINAR: com base em nome, endereço, instituições de ensino, origem regional
- AVALIAR APENAS: habilidades relevantes, experiência profissional, qualificações para a vaga
- GARANTIR: tratamento justo independente de características protegidas
- FORNECER: razoamento transparente para todas as decisões de pontuação

BASE LEGAL:
- Constituição Federal Art. 3º, IV e Art. 5º, I
- Lei nº 9.029/95 - Proibição de discriminação

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Integration Points

1. **Service Level Integration:**

   ```python
   # Score Improvement Service
   anti_discrimination_rules = self.bias_service.create_anti_discrimination_prompt("scoring")

   # Job Service
   bias_issues = parsed_response.get("potential_bias_issues", [])
   compliance_flags = parsed_response.get("compliance_flags", [])

   # Resume Service
   bias_detected = parsed_response.get("potential_bias_detected", [])
   compliance_notes = parsed_response.get("compliance_notes", [])
   ```

2. **Bias Detection Service:**

   ```python
   from services.bias_detection_service import bias_detection_service

   result = bias_detection_service.analyze_text_bias(text, "resume")
   ```

3. **Compliance Logging:**
   ```python
   if bias_issues or compliance_flags:
       logger.warning(f"Analysis detected potential bias issues: {bias_issues}")
   ```

### Database Integration

All bias detection events are logged with:

- Processing ID for audit trails
- Timestamp for compliance tracking
- Bias severity and confidence scores
- Required human review flags
- Legal basis references
