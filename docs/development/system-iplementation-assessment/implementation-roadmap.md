- **Phase 2 (Weeks 8-11):** Enhanced Features - LLM integration and advanced scoring
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 12-14):** UI/UX Integration - Complete user interface and testing

**Success Metrics:**

- Phase 0 security fixes completed and verified
- On-time delivery of all subsequent phases
- 90%+ test coverage achieved
- Performance benchmarks met (<3s processing time)
- User acceptance testing passed with >85% satisfaction
