## 🔄 What Changed

After completing verification, we discovered that what was completed was:

- ✅ **Week 0-2: Infrastructure** (complete)
- ❌ **P0: Core Services** (not started)

The original assessment incorrectly assumed P0 was complete when only infrastructure was done.

---

## 📋 Updated Documentation

Please refer to these corrected documents:

### 1. **Infrastructure Status** ✅

**File**: `INFRASTRUCTURE-VERIFICATION-COMPLETE.md`

What's actually done:

- Docker services ✅
- Security infrastructure ✅
- Frontend build ✅
- i18n configuration ✅
- 59/59 tests passing ✅

### 2. **P0 Checklist (Corrected)** ⏳

**File**: `P0-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` (updated)

What still needs to be done:

- Resume processing services ❌
- Job matching algorithm ❌
- LLM agent system ❌
- API endpoints ❌
- End-to-end workflow ❌

## 🎯 Current Reality

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure - COMPLETE

## 🚀 What To Do Next
