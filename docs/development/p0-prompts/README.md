## 🚀 How to Use These Prompts

### Step 1: Open Claude with Agent

1. Navigate to project root:
   ```bash
   cd /home/carlos/projects/cv-match
   ```

2. Open Claude with specific agent:
   ```bash
   # For Phase 1 - Backend Services
   claude --agent backend-specialist
   ```

3. Copy-paste the entire prompt from the markdown file

### Step 2: Monitor Progress

Each agent will:
- Execute the tasks listed
- Create/modify files
- Run verification commands
- Report success/failure

### Step 3: Verify Completion

After each agent completes:
- Run the verification checklist from the prompt
- Ensure all success criteria are met
- Commit changes before next phase

### Step 4: Move to Next Phase

Once a phase is complete and verified:
- Move to the next prompt in sequence
- For parallel phases, launch both agents simultaneously

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Dependencies

Each phase has strict dependencies:
- Phase 2 needs Phase 1 complete (needs service files for schemas)
- Phase 3 needs Phase 2 complete (needs tables for endpoints)
- Phase 4 needs Phase 3 complete (needs endpoints for testing)

### Parallel Execution

Only these can run in parallel:
- Phase 1: Backend Specialist + AI Integration Specialist (independent)
- Phase 4: Test Writer + Frontend Specialist (independent)

### Error Handling

If an agent fails:
1. Check the verification checklist in its prompt
2. Review error messages
3. Fix issues manually if needed
4. Re-run that specific agent
5. Don't proceed to next phase until current phase passes

### Git Commits

After EACH phase:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Phase X complete: [description]"
```

This allows rollback if needed.
