## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision for Migration

### Readiness Checklist
- [x] ✅ Payment infrastructure tested (17 integration tests)
- [x] ✅ Security hardened (LLM injection prevention)
- [x] ✅ Environment documented (.env.example complete)
- [x] ✅ Error tracking ready (Sentry integration 15 min)

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Week 1)
1. **Add Sentry DSN** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Sign up: sentry.io
   # Add to .env:
   SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
   ```

2. **Run Full Test Suite** (30 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```

3. **Review Test Coverage Report** (15 minutes)
   - Open `htmlcov/index.html`
   - Ensure critical paths > 95%

### Week 1: Backend Services Migration
**Start Date**: Tomorrow (Oct 8, 2025)
**Duration**: 5 days

Follow [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) P0 tasks:
- Day 1-2: Copy resume processing services
- Day 3-4: Apply database migrations
- Day 5: Create API endpoints

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Structured approach**: Code audit → Requirements → Implementation
2. **Test-driven**: Tests written alongside features
3. **Documentation-first**: Every feature documented
4. **Brazilian market focus**: Market-specific fixtures and tests
5. **Security-first mindset**: Defense-in-depth from day 1

### What Could Be Improved 📝
1. **Earlier test automation**: Could have set up CI/CD earlier
2. **Parallel work**: Could have split security + payments across 2 devs
3. **Staging environment**: Should spin up staging for final validation

### Recommendations for Week 1-4
1. **Continue test-driven approach**: Write tests as you migrate
2. **Daily security reviews**: Ensure copied code maintains security posture
3. **Progressive deployment**: Deploy to staging after each week
4. **Performance monitoring**: Track latency as services are added
