## üí° Pricing Psychology & Strategy

### Brazilian Market Pricing Tactics

#### 1. **Anchoring**

```
Show this progression:
Flex 10:  R$ 29,90  (R$ 2,99/credit)
Flex 25:  R$ 59,90  (R$ 2,40/credit) ‚≠ê 20% savings
Flex 50:  R$ 99,90  (R$ 2,00/credit) ‚≠ê 33% savings

Makes R$ 59,90 feel like a smart middle choice
```

#### 2. **Decoy Pricing**

```
Flow Starter:  R$ 24,90/month  (15 analyses)  ‚Üê Decoy
Flow Pro:      R$ 49,90/month  (60 analyses)  ‚≠ê 4x value, 2x price
Flow Business: R$ 129,90/month (250 analyses)
```

Starter exists to make Pro look amazing

#### 3. **Bundle Savings**

```
Individual analysis (if possible): R$ 4,99
Flex 25 package: R$ 59,90 (R$ 2,40/credit)
Savings headline: "Save 52% with Flex 25"
```

#### 4. **Subscription Savings Framing**

```
Credit user spending:
R$ 59,90 every month = R$ 719,40/year

Flow Pro:
R$ 49,90/month = R$ 598,80/year
"Save R$ 120,60 per year with Flow Pro!"
```

#### 5. **Brazilian Currency Formatting**

- Use comma for decimal: R$ 49,90 (not R$ 49.90)
- Avoid decimal when possible: R$ 50 (feels cleaner)
- Payment plans: "12x R$ 4,99" for annual plans
- PIX discount: "Pay with PIX, get 5% off"
