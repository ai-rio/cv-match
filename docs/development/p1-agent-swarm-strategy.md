## 📊 Risk Assessment

| Risk                     | Severity    | Mitigation                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Double-charging users    | 🔴 Critical | Idempotency keys, database constraints    |
| Webhook signature bypass | 🔴 Critical | Strict signature verification             |
| Credit race conditions   | 🟡 High     | Atomic transactions, database locks       |
| BRL conversion errors    | 🟡 High     | Test with real Stripe BRL prices          |
| Webhook replay attacks   | 🟡 High     | Timestamp validation, event deduplication |
| Free tier abuse          | 🟢 Medium   | Rate limiting, IP tracking                |

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (test-writer-agent):

- Stripe service methods
- Usage limit checking
- Credit deduction logic
- Payment verification

### Integration Tests:

- Webhook processing end-to-end
- Payment → Credit → Optimization flow
- Subscription creation/cancellation
- Failed payment handling

### E2E Tests:

- Complete purchase flow (test mode)
- Credit deduction on optimization
- Zero credits blocking
- Payment success → immediate access

### Manual Tests (Critical):

- Test with real Stripe test cards
- Verify BRL pricing displays correctly
- Test webhook in Stripe Dashboard
- Verify all Portuguese translations

---

## 📋 Environment Variables Needed

### Stripe Configuration:

```bash
# Backend
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BASIC=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_...

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### Usage Limits:

```bash
FREE_TIER_CREDITS=3
BASIC_TIER_CREDITS=10
PRO_TIER_CREDITS=50
CREDIT_REFILL_INTERVAL=monthly
```

## 🎯 Key Differences from P0

### P0 (Core Product):

- Focus: Make product work
- Complexity: Medium
- Risk: Low
- Testing: Unit + Integration

### P1 (Payment Integration):

- Focus: Make money
- Complexity: High (financial security)
- Risk: **Critical** (financial)
- Testing: Unit + Integration + **E2E + Manual**

**Extra care needed**: Double-check all payment logic, test thoroughly, never skip security reviews.
