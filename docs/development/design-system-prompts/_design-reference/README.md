# 📚 Design Reference Documentation

**Purpose:** Original design intent and component research  
**Audience:** Human developers, designers, product managers  
**Status:** Reference only - Not for AI agent consumption

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice

These documents contain the **original design intent** for the CV-Match design system. They include:

- Detailed component mappings
- Registry research and proposals
- Implementation roadmaps
- Conflict resolution strategies

### Why These Are Archived:

1. **Contains Hypothetical Registries**
   - Documents reference `@aceternity-ui`, `@kibo-ui`, `@ai-sdk` as if they exist
   - May cause AI agents to hallucinate component APIs
   - Not safe for direct AI agent consumption

2. **Superseded by Implementation Prompts**
   - The 01-10 prompts in the parent directory are the actual implementation guides
   - These docs were planning/research phase
   - Implementation prompts include verification and fallback strategies

3. **Still Valuable for Humans**
   - Explains design decisions and rationale
   - Documents component requirements
   - Useful for understanding the "why" behind implementation choices

## 🎯 How to Use These Docs

### For Human Developers:

**Use these when you need to:**
- Understand original design goals
- See why certain components were chosen
- Reference component requirements
- Review architectural decisions

**Don't use these for:**
- Direct AI agent prompts
- Component installation commands
- Registry configuration (registries may not exist)

### For AI Agents:

**❌ DO NOT READ THESE FILES**

Instead, use:
- `../START_HERE.md` - Entry point with anti-hallucination protocol
- `../01-10-*.md` - Actual implementation prompts
- `../ANTI-HALLUCINATION-PROTOCOL.md` - Verification procedures
- `../FALLBACK_STRATEGY.md` - Custom implementations

## 📊 Key Insights from These Docs

### What Worked:
- ✅ OKLCH color system approach
- ✅ Brazilian market adaptations
- ✅ Component organization strategy
- ✅ Accessibility requirements

### What Changed:
- ⚠️ Aceternity UI may not exist → Use fallback
- ⚠️ Multiple registries → Simplified to shadcn + custom
- ⚠️ Complex conflict resolution → Verification-first approach

   - How to plan component libraries
   - Multi-registry strategies
   - Conflict prevention approaches

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Mapping UX needs to components
   - Registry-specific usage patterns
   - Type safety considerations

## 🔍 When to Reference vs. Implement

| Scenario | Use This Folder | Use Parent Folder |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Understanding design goals | ✅ | - |
| Seeing component requirements | ✅ | - |
| **Actually implementing** | ❌ | **✅ Use 01-10 prompts** |
| AI agent tasks | ❌ | **✅ Use START_HERE.md** |
| Verifying registries | ❌ | **✅ Use ANTI-HALLUCINATION** |
| Custom components | ❌ | **✅ Use FALLBACK_STRATEGY** |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Keep these docs for **design intent reference**, but **use the parent folder's prompts for actual implementation**.

The parent folder includes:
- Reality-based component sources
- Verification protocols
- Fallback strategies
- AI-safe prompts
