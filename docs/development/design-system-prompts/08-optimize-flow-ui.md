## üîç Type Checking Integration

### Post-Implementation Type Check Instructions

After implementing the optimize flow UI components, perform comprehensive type checking to ensure type safety across the upload, form, and results components.

### Phase-Specific Type Validation Commands

Execute the following commands in sequence to validate types:

```bash
# Run the project's type check script
bun run type-check

# Strict type checking for optimize app routes
npx tsc --noEmit src/app/optimize/**/*.tsx --strict

# Strict type checking for file upload components
npx tsc --noEmit src/components/file-upload/**/*.tsx --strict

# Type validation for flow-specific types
npx tsc --noEmit src/types/flow.ts --strict
```

### Type Validation Checklist

- [ ] All optimize app routes compile without type errors
- [ ] File upload components have proper prop types
- [ ] Form validation maintains type safety
- [ ] Results display components are properly typed
- [ ] Flow state management is type-safe
- [ ] File handling operations have correct types

### Type Error Resolution Guidance

If encountering type errors:

1. **File Upload Types**: Ensure file objects and event handlers are properly typed
2. **Form Validation**: Verify form data structures match validation schemas
3. **Results Types**: Check that API response types match results component expectations
4. **Flow State**: Ensure state transitions between upload, form, and results are typed
5. **File Processing**: Verify file processing functions have proper input/output types
