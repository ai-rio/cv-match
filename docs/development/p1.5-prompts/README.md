## 🚨 Important Notes

### Backwards Compatibility

**CRITICAL**: Must not break existing credit system!

- Existing users keep their credits
- Credit purchases still work
- No data migration needed
- Additive changes only

### Testing Strategy

Test BOTH systems work:

- [ ] Credit purchase flow
- [ ] Subscription purchase flow
- [ ] Credit usage
- [ ] Subscription limits
- [ ] Upgrades between systems
- [ ] Existing users unaffected

### Deployment Strategy

**Recommended**: Feature flag

```python
SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED = os.getenv("ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS", "true")
```

This allows:

- Gradual rollout
- A/B testing
- Quick rollback if needed
