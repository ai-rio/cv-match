## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### Before Starting:

1. ⚠️ Read **00-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md** first
2. ⚠️ Read **00-AGENT-TOOLS-GUIDE.md** for tool requirements
3. ⚠️ Read **00-LOCALIZATION-GUIDE.md** for i18n rules
4. ⚠️ Use correct specialist agent for each prompt
5. ⚠️ Respect parallel vs sequential execution

### During Execution:

- ✅ Use Context7 for library documentation
- ✅ Use Shadcn for UI components
- ✅ Use next-intl for ALL text (no hardcoded strings)
- ✅ Test incrementally after each task
- ✅ Commit after each major milestone
- ✅ Follow verification checklists

### Quality Gates:

- ❌ Never proceed to next phase without completing current
- ❌ Never skip verification tests
- ❌ Never hardcode text (use translations)
- ❌ Never guess APIs (use Context7)
- ❌ Never build UI from scratch (use Shadcn)
