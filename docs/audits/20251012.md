
## 🔍 **404 Error on `/optimize` Route - Complete Diagnosis**

### 🎯 **Root Cause**

The `/optimize` page was placed **outside** the `[locale]` directory structure, but the app uses next-intl for internationalization which requires all pages to be under `/app/[locale]/`.

### 📁 **File Structure Issue**

**Before (Wrong)**:
```
/app/optimize/page.tsx          ❌ Outside locale structure
/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx ✅ Inside locale
/app/[locale]/login/page.tsx    ✅ Inside locale
/app/[locale]/pricing/page.tsx  ✅ Inside locale
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
/app/[locale]/optimize/page.tsx  ✅ Now inside locale structure
```

### ✅ **Fix Applied**

```bash
mv /app/optimize → /app/[locale]/optimize
```

Now the route will work as:
- ✅ `/pt-br/optimize` (Portuguese)
- ✅ `/en/optimize` (English)

### ⚠️ **Other Pages Still Outside Locale**

These pages also exist outside `[locale]` and may have similar issues:
```
/app/auth/          - Authentication pages
/app/dashboard/     - Old dashboard (duplicate exists in [locale])
/app/payment/       - Payment pages
/app/results/       - Results pages  
/app/upload/        - Upload pages
```

**Recommendation**: Move these to `/app/[locale]/` structure or verify they're intentionally outside (like API routes).

### 🧪 **Test the Fix**

The `/optimize` route should now work:

```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/pt-br/optimize  ✅ Should work
http://localhost:3000/en/optimize     ✅ Should work
http://localhost:3000/optimize        ❌ Will redirect to /pt-br/optimize
```

**The 404 error should be resolved!** The page is now in the correct location for next-intl routing. 🎉

Would you like me to:
1. Move the other pages into the locale structure?
2. Test the `/optimize` route with Chrome DevTools?
3. Check for any other routing issues?
