- **Sections**: Personal data, professional summary, work experience, education, skills, courses/certifications, and references.
- For **international roles**, omit photo/age, focus on results with metrics, and translate qualifications to globally understood terms.[13]

### Role of Optimization vs Networking

- **Networking remains paramount** in Brazil’s relationship-driven culture, especially in tech hubs like São Paulo and Rio.
